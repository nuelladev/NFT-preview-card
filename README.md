## Overview
Welcome to the NFT Preview Card Component project, created by Emmanuella Okafor. This project showcases a responsive preview card component with an interactive sound effect using JavaScript. The card design has been implemented with CSS, making it visually appealing and engaging for users.

## The Challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My Process
I built this project using HTML and CSS to create the layout and design of the card. To make it interactive, I used JavaScript to add a sound effect triggered by clicking on the NFT image. The project also boasts a responsive design, ensuring that users can enjoy the optimal experience on various device screen sizes.

## Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I learned to use the adjacent sibling selector in CSS to make the view icon appear on hover:

```css
.view {
  display: none;
}

.image-container:hover .overlay + .view {
  display: block;
}
